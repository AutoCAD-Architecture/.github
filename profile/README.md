## Overview

AutoCAD offers a comprehensive environment for drafting and design, combining traditional drawing tools with advanced 3D modeling and documentation capabilities. It supports precision workflows needed for architectural plans, mechanical parts, civil engineering designs, and more. Whether you're creating detailed blueprints or 3D prototypes, AutoCAD delivers accuracy and flexibility.

Its tools include parametric drawing, layer and block management, annotation tools, advanced object snapping, and customizable workspaces. For 3D work, AutoCAD supports modeling, rendering previews, and visualization tools, allowing designers to shift seamlessly from 2D drafting to 3D conceptualization.  

With strong support for documentation — including layouts, printing settings, and export options — AutoCAD streamlines the process from initial design to final blueprints. Its widespread use in professional industries makes it a reliable standard for CAD work globally.
